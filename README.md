### Web scrapper for the *Only Connect* game

This project creates a binary that scraps content from [this](https://ocdb.cc/)
database.

More fonctionnalities are to be added, but for the moment it is designed
to be used with [pi-connect-maker](https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect-maker).
Just compile the binary and put it inside the **pi-connect-maker** 
repository and the games should be generated.
